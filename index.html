						<strong>Hi there</strong> I am a New York-based technologist with a creative bent and diverse interests 
						that have shaped my work as a product leader, helping me innovate and effectively  collaborate with teams. 
						Below is a selection of my professional work and personal projects.

					<h2 class="icon fa-building">Work</h2>
					<p>
						Most of my work days are spent defining, building and managing useful and impactful software products. 
						I currently lead Product and UX teams at <img src="images/logo-ebay.svg" style="height:1.1em; margin:0 0 0 3px; vertical-align:-4px" alt="eBay">, 
						focusing on transformative solutions and exploring opportunities to leverage generative AI.
					</p>
					<p>
						Over two tenures at <img src="images/logo-google.svg" style="height: 2.2em; margin: 0 0 0 3px; vertical-align: -13px;" alt="Google" /> 
						my teams launched new, ML-enhanced tools and grew platforms including <a href="https://material.io" target="_blank">Material Design</a> 
						and <strong>Google+</strong>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Earlier in my career, I focused on UI development and lead engineering teams at MLB's 
						<a href="https://www.bamtechmedia.com/" target="_blank">BAM Tech</a> (which has since become Disney 
						Streaming), Meebo and other startups.
					</p>
					<h3>Along the way, I founded two companies</h3>
					<p>
						<img src="images/screenshot-blend.png" class="image right">
						<img src="images/logo-blend.svg" style="height:1.8em; margin:0 3px 0 0; vertical-align:-6px;">, 
						the music collaboration platform described as "GitHub for music" was backed by Betaworks and launched 
						in 2013. My team and I grew the product into a global community of more than <strong>500K music collaborators</strong>, 
						remixers and learners whose creative workflows were streamlined with a fast, cloud-backed file sync solution, 
						while regular artist features, contests and promotions fueled creative output.
					</p>
					<p>
						With its mission to <em>help creators succeed</em>, Blend also offered a crowdsourced label that let 
						artists on the platform distribute their music to all digital streaming services once their releases 
						achieved community engagement milestones. The Blend Label was covered by 
						<a href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/blend-announces-record-label-distribution-deal-with-the-orchard-cloud/" target="_blend">Billboard</a>, 
						among others. 
					</p>
					<p>
						In 2015, about 18 months after its launch, Blend was acquired by <a href="https://www.roli.com" target="_blank">ROLI</a>, 
						the London-based creator of award-winning musical instruments. At ROLI, I established the company's web and cloud operations from the ground up &#8212; 
						hiring the team, shaping a comprehensive strategy, and shipping new infrastructure and products that interconnected ROLI’s hardware, 
						software, and developer products their creative communities. A key initiative was the conception and launch of <a href="https://noise.fm" target="_blank">NOISE.fm</a>, 
						a Blend-inspired platform fully integrated with ROLI's Blocks hardware and mobile apps, which debuted in an exclusive partnership with Apple in 2016.
						I shared a few reflections following Blend's 2024 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7212576563639263232/" target="_blank">sunset</a>.

						was a photo management and sharing platform I bootstrapped in 2005.
					</p>
					<p>
						An early adopter of Amazon's S3 service - the first and only AWS product at the time - Gallerama offered 
						free and subscription-based plans, and served photographers and their audience on desktop and iOS for more 
						than 15 years. I wrote about 
						<a href="https://medium.com/@kolumbo/insights-from-my-bootstrapped-startup-fail-3-lessons-learned-798f6143aca" target="_blank">lessons learned</a> 
						from building Gallerama on Medium</a>.

					</h2>
					<p>
						When I'm not building and shipping software with teams, I'm drawn to creating in other areas. While this is a 
						good way to unwind, it also keeps creative juices flowing and satisfies my urge to continuously ship new things.
					</p>	
					<p>
						Here are some of my interests and projects.

					<h2>Sound Design</h2>

					<h2>Guitar</h2>
					<p>	
						<span class="image right"><img src="images/alex-in-1997.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						A lifelong passion for music was fueled with guitar playing as a teenager. This included playing in various bands, 
						notably <strong>Kill by Inches</strong>, a New York-based group that often performed in the city's music scene. 
						(Check out that snap from a show at McCarren Park in Brooklyn. The guitar in the photo is still
						by my desk and I maintain a strong taste in headless guitars.)
						<br/><br/>
						David Gilmour once noted that sometimes you pick up a new guitar and "it gifts you a song". This phenomenon 
						is something I can relate to. Over the years I've owned more than 30 guitars though most of them end up sold 
						leaving a much smaller collection.
					</p>
					<!-- <br/><h3>Riffs On Beats</h3> -->
					<p>
						<span class="image left"><img src="images/logo-riffsonbeats.png" alt="" /></span>
						Sometimes a guitar riff comes to you and you just have to run with it. Drums, bass guitar and keys often complete 
						the idea. And, a quick video captures the performance and makes it easy to revisit.
						<br/><br/>
						After a few of these, I challenged myself to make such a thing every week for a year, posting these creations on 
						<a href="https://www.instagram.com/riffsonbeats" target="_blank">@riffsonbeats on Instagram</a>. After a 
						brief break, the series continued at a more sensible pace.

					</div>	
					<br/>
					<p>
						A few years ago, I recorded a video of myself playing the Guns N' Roses classic <em>Sweet Child O' Mine</em>, 
						on my son's mini Les Paul guitar. Surprisingly popular, that 
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nspAvIvq6Wg" target="_blank">video has over 700,000 views</a> on YouTube.

					<h2><img src="images/logo-futro.svg" alt="Futro Guitars" style="height:1.3em; vertical-align:-6px;"/> Guitars</h2>
					<p>
						Guitar tinkering eventually led to building them nearly from scratch. Now, the hunt is on for unique vintage parts that 
						deserve a second chance. When something special turns up, it's a chance to get creative - preserving the old-school vibe 
						while adding some modern magic. I'm branding these creations: Futro.
					</p>

					<h3>Futro <span>#3</span></h3>
					<p>
						Born on September 7th, 2024, this guitar features a distinctive Japanese neck with scalloped high frets, showing signs 
						of being well-played over many years before it found its way to me. After extensive restoration, I paired it with a 
						custom-made body, stained with leather dye and finished in layers of Tru-Oil. Its soul lies in a unique set of second-hand 
						pickups, arranged in a configuration I’ve yet to encounter elsewhere.
					</p>

						</div>
					</div>

					<h3>Futro <span>#2</span></h3>
					<p>
						While some of these instruments are designed to highlight their age and mojo, the goal with this one was entirely different.
						Assembled in August 2024, this guitar is an old fantasy finally realized. Gloss black with light colored binding is my all-time 
						favorite finish and it covers a carved top holding a set of Tom Anderson P90 pickups; the heart of this guitar.

					<h3>Futro <span>#1</span></h3>
					<p>
						This project kicked off with a vintage neck from the 1980s, which I sanded and refinished. Next up was 
						leveling and polishing the frets - a first time endeavor. The body was built by Warmoth in Tacoma, 
						and was stained with leather dye and lacquered in my backyard.
					</p>
					<p>In August of 2022, I gifted this guitar to my father - my first guitar teacher - and it has lived in my parents' home in Belgrade since.</p>

					<h3>Futro <span>#0</span></h3>
					<p>
						This stratocaster clone was spec'd and assembled in 2021 around an exceptional second-hand neck and vintage Fender pickups.
						The USA-made swamp ash body was finished and aged by MJT in Missouri. I assembled and lightly aged the rest to match its vibe.

								A few years ago, I challenged myself to come up with guitar riff, flesh it out in a full tune with drums and bass, and then record it. To make it easier to share and view - and to remember how to play it - I made a video of me playing it as well.
								I did this every week for a year, posting these creations on @riffsonbeats on Instagram.
